### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because I was curious about how the code would find spelling errors in each word and put it into vectors. I was able to write the function that will look at each word and see if there is a spelling error. I then realized that the whole point of this lab is to know how to make a code that would create vectors and how to define functions. It was amazing to see it work.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the code would alter the color of the picture. I was able to write the function of altering the amount of pixel color to the RGB of each pixel. I then realized that the point of the lab was to be able to write 2D vectors. As I watched it, it blew my mind.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite because I was about to write a code that can make an animated gif. I was able to write the function that would alter the color and make it move. I then realized that the whole point of the lab was to learn how to use trigonometric funtcions to make a lookup table. As I saw it work for the first time, it was a great accomplishment.
