### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because I was curious about how the code would find speeling errors in each word.
    I was able to write the function of each word being looked at and corrected. It was amazing to see it work.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the code would alter the color of the picture. I was able to write the function of altering the amount of pixel color to the RGB of each pixel. As I watched it, it blow my mind.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite because I was about to write a code that can make an animated gif. I was able to write the function that would alter the color and make it move. As I saw it work for the first time, it was a great accomplishment
